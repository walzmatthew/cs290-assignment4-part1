Tasks: Committing loopback.php. Currently the page interprets whether or not a GET or POST request was sent. If GET request than it checks that at least one key/value pair was submitted. It then creates an array storing the request in the 'type' index and the key/value pairs in the 'parameter' index. It then outputs a JSON encoding of that array to the terminal. Next step is to create a POST form which sends a POST request to the page to test it's handling of POST requests.
